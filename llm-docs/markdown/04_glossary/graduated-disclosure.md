# graduated-disclosure

a disclosure of an [ACDC](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/ACDC.md) that does not reveal its entire content in the initial interaction with the recipient and, instead, partially or selectively reveals only the information contained within the ACDC necessary to further a transaction with the recipient. A Graduated disclosure may involve multiple steps where more information is progressively revealed as the recipient satisfies the conditions set by the [discloser](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/discloser.md). [Compact disclosure](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/compact-disclosure.md), [Partial disclosure](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/partial-disclosure.md), [Selective disclosure](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/selective-disclosure.md), and [Full disclosure](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/full-disclosure.md) are all Graduated disclosure mechanisms.

Lifting confidentiality step by step: Selectively disclosing more data as time and/or necessity progresses, offering backward verifiability of earlier issued cryptographic proofs.

You proof your insurance policy without disclosing details before enjoying extreme sports. Only when something goes wrong, e.g., 1 in 100, do you disclose the data. This way confidentiality is kept in 99% of the cases.

Disclosure performed by a presentation exchange that has cross-variant (see [compact variant](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/compact-variant.md)) Issuer commitment verifiability as an essential property. It supports graduated disclosure by the [Disclosee](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/disclosee.md) of any or all variants wether it be full, compact, metadata, partial, selective, bulk issued, or contractually protected.

The [SAID](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/SAID.md) of a given variant is useful even when it is not the SAID of the variant the [Issuer](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/issuer.md) signed because during graduated disclosure the [Discloser](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/discloser.md) MAY choose to sign that given variant to fulfil a given step in an IPEX graduated disclosure transaction.

The disclosure performed by a presentation exchange MAY be [graduated](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/graduated-disclosure.md) and MAY be [contractually](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/contractually-protected-disclosure.md) protected.

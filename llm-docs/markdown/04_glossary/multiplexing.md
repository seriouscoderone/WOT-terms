# multiplexing

In [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications) and [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), multiplexing (sometimes contracted to _muxing_) is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a [shared medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_medium). The aim is to share a scarce resource - a physical [transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium).

Because of [count codes](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/count-code.md) and the [composability](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/composability.md) - and [concatenation](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/concatenation.md) property in CESR, [pipelining](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/pipelining.md) is possible, which then uses _multiplexing_ (combining [self-framing](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/self-framing.md) primitives) and _de-multiplexing_ (unravelling self-framing [primitives](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/primitive.md)). The addition of group framing codes as independently composable primitives enables [hierarchical compositions](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/hierarchical-composition.md).

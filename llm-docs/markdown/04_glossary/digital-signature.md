# digital-signature

A _digital_ signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).

There are `digital signatures` and [Electronic signatures](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/electronic-signature.md), the latter are quite different in purpose and practical use.

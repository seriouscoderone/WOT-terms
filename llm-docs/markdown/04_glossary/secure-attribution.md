# secure-attribution

Secure attribution is strongly related to _making and proving statements_. A [controller](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/controller.md) makes statements to the a [validator](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/validator.md) or [verifier](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/verifier.md), who in turn validates the statements issued. A [controller](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/controller.md) "_owns_" the statement: content and attribution via digital signatures. Secure attribution is "whodunit?!" in cyberspace.

_Secure attribution of a statement_ is a way of proving that **the statement is an authentic statement of the `controller`**.

In the context of KERI and ACDC _secure_ means a **`Validator` may cryptographically verify** the statement.

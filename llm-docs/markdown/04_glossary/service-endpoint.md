# service-endpoint

In our context we consider a **web service endpoint** which is a [URL](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/uniform-resource-locator.md) at which clients of specific service can get access to the service.

By referencing that URL, clients can get to operations provided by that service.

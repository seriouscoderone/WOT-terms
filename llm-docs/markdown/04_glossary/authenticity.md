# authenticity

The quality of having an objectively verifiable origin ; contrast [veracity](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/veracity.md). When a newspaper publishes a story about an event, every faithful reproduction of that story may be _authentic_ — but that does not mean the story was _true_ (has _veracity_).

Authenticity is strongly related to digital [security](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/security.md). Ideally it should be [verifiable](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/verifiable.md) (to a [root-of-trust](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/root-of-trust.md)). The future picture therein is the [Authentic Web](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/authentic-web.md).

The three properties, authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy inhabit a trade space. ... One can have any two of the three (privacy, authenticity, confidentiality) at the highest level but not all three.
The trilemma insists that one must make a trade-off by prioritizing one or two properties over a third.

The ToIP [design goals](https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md#61-design-goals) reflect that trade-off and provide an order of importance. The design goals indicate that one should start with high authenticity, then high confidentiality, and then as high as possible privacy, given there is no trade-off with respect to the other two.

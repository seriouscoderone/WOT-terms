# delegated-identifier

Matches the act of [delegation](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/delegation.md) with the appropriate digital twin. Consequently when applied recursively, delegation may be used to compose arbitrarily complex trees of hierarchical (delegative) key management event streams. This is a most powerful capability that may provide an essential building block for a generic universal decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI) that is also compatible with the demand of generic event streaming applications.

The KERI design approach is to build composable primitives instead of custom functionality that is so typical of other DKMI approaches:

-   [transferable identifiers](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/transferable-identifier.md)
-   [non-transferable identifiers](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/non-transferable-identifier.md)
-   delegated identifiers

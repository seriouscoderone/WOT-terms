# autonomic-trust-basis

When we use an [AID](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/AID.md) as the [root-of-trust](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/root-of-trust.md) we form a so-called _autonomic trust basis_. This is diagrammed as follows:

Two other trust bases are in common use for identifier systems. One we call _algorithmic_, the other is .

An algorithmic trust basis relies on some network of nodes running some type of Byzantine fault tolerant totally ordering distributed consensus algorithm for its root-of-trust. These networks are more commonly known as a shared ledger or blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Sovrin

The other commonly used trust basis in identifier systems is an _administrative_ or organizational _trust basis_, i.e. a trusted entity. This is neither [secure](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/security.md) nor [decentralized](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/decentralized-identifier.md).

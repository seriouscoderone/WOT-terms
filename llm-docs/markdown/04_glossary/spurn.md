To _reject_. In KERI, "spurn" refers to a cryptographic or protocol-based act of rejecting an invalid or untrusted event. This rejection is deliberate and purposeful, ensuring the system's integrity by disregarding information that does not meet the necessary validation criteria. The verb 'spurn' is first used in the [IPEX](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/IPEX.md) specification.

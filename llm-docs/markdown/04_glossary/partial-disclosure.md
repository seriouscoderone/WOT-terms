# partial-disclosure

a disclosure of an ACDC that partially discloses its field maps using Compact Disclosure. The Compact Disclosure provides a cryptographically equivalent commitment to the yet-to-be-disclosed content, and the later exchange of the uncompacted content is verifiable to an earlier Partial Disclosure. Unlike Selective disclosure, a partially disclosable field becomes correlatable to its encompassing block after its Full Disclosure.

An ACDC attribute section can be a nested branch in a tree. Partial disclosure is the weaker version because you can either decide to disclose or not. Selective disclosure is more fine-grained.

[Selective disclosure](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/selective-disclosure.md) is a from partial disclosure that has a different cryptographic fundament: a sort of cryptographic aggregator (not an accumulator).

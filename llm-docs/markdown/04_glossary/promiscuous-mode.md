# promiscuous-mode

It is the mode a [watcher](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/watcher.md) runs in. A watcher uses the same code as a [witness](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/witness.md). However a watcher does so "lacking standards of selection; acting without careful judgment; indiscriminate". Or "Showing little forethought or critical judgment; casual."

The function of watcher is different from a witness, however they can both use the same protocol and code, just in a distinct mode.

# data-anchor

Data anchors are [digests](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/digest.md) of digital data, that uniquely identify this data. The digest is the anchor and can be used to identify - and point to the data at the same time.

The act of creating the digest of arbitrary data and then hook (or reference) the digest to (in) another data structure is called 'anchoring data'.

[SADs](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/self-addressing-data.md) are a type of data anchors.

[Link anchors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#Anchor_links) are a totally different concepts.

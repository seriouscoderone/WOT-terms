# veracity

The quality of being true; contrast [authenticity](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/authenticity.md). When a newspaper publishes a story about an event, every faithful reproduction of that story may be _authentic_ — but that does not mean the story was true (has _veracity_).

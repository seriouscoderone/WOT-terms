# issuance-and-presentation-exchange-protocol

provides a uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs in a securely attributable manner.

A single protocol is able to work for both types of exchanges ([issuance](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/issuance-exchange.md) and [presentation](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/presentation-exchange.md)) by recognizing that all exchanges (both issuance and presentation) may be modeled as the disclosure of information by a [Discloser](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/discloser.md) to a [Disclosee](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/disclosee.md).
The _difference_ between exchange types is _the information disclosed not the mechanism for disclosure_.

A mechanism that can unambiguously assess whether the information is/continues to be whole, sound and unimpaired

-   In KERI's secure attribution focus integrity is verified by [internal consistency](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/internal-inconsistency.md) of [KE(R)L](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/key-event-receipt-log.md) and [TEL](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/transaction-event-log.md) plus [duplicity](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/duplicity.md) detection.
-   In ACDC the [self addressing identifier](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/self-addressing-identifier.md) (SAID) takes of verified integrity at all times by design
-   The streaming protocol CESR has verifiable integrity due to it's code tables and round-robin [composability](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/composability.md).

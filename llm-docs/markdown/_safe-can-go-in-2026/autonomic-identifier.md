# root-autonomic-identifier

An entity may provide the [root-of-trust](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/root-of-trust.md) for some ecosystem (with delegation )via its root [AID](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/AID.md). Let’s call this the _RID_ for "root AID". The RID must be protected using the highest level of [security](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/security.md) in its [key management](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/key-management.md).

Although through the use of a [multi-valent](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/multi-valent.md) key management infrastructure, the entity can employ extreme protection of the RID while still enabling more performant key management infrastructure for its operations.

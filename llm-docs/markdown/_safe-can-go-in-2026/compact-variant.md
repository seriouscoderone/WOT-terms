# compact-variant

Either a [most compact](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/most-compact.md) version of an ACDC or the [fully compact](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/fully-compact.md) version of an ACDC. An [Issuer](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/issuer.md) commitment via a signature to any variant of ACDC (compact, full, etc) makes a cryptographic commitment to the top-level section fields shared by all variants of that ACDC because the value of a [top level section field](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/top-level-section.md) is either the [SAD](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/SAD.md) or the [SAID](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/SAID.md) of the SAD of the associated section.

All the variants of an [ACDC](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/authentic-chained-data-container.md) are various degrees of expansion of the compact variant.

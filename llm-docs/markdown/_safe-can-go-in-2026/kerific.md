# kerific

_kerific_ is a front plugin or extension that currently only works for Chrome and Brave. It matches words in any text on the web that is parseable for kerific and offers buttons to various glossaries and definitions in the [SSI](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/self-sovereign-identity.md) field.

All glossaries that [KERISSE](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/KERISSE.md) is allowed to scrape are combined in the [Dictionary SSI](https://weboftrust.github.io/keridoc/docs/dictionary?level=2). This is based on a large JSON file, which kerific uses to match words in any text and serve the combined glossaries.

It is in the [Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kerific/ckbmkbbmnfbeecfmoiohobcdmopekgmp?hl=nl)

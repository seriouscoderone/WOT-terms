Explained briefly, an ACDC or [ADC](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/authentic-data-container.md) proves digital data consistency and authenticity in one go. An ACDC cryptographically secures commitment to the data contained, and its identifiers are self-addressing, which means they point to themselves and are also contained in the data.

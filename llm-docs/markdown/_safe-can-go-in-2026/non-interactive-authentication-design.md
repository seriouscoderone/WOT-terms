# non-interactive-authentication-design

A group of approaches having non-interactive mechanisms that pose unique problems because they do not allow a challenge response reply handshake. A request is submitted that is self-authenticating without additional interaction.

The main benefits of non-interactive authentication are scalability and path independent end-to-end verifiability. These benefits become more important in decentralized applications that employ [zero-trust](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/zero-trust.md) architectures.

# duplicity-detection

A mechanism to detect [duplicity](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/duplicity.md) in cryptographically secured event logs.

Duplicity detection, which protects, _not against an external attacker_, but against a malicious [controller](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/controller.md) does require access to [watchers](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/watcher.md) that are also recording duplicitous events.

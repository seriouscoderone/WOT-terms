KERI explicitly distinguishes [keystore](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/keystore.md) and [wallet](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/wallet.md); the latter being a superset of the former. [Keep](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/keep.md) is KERI's and ACDC's user interface with Keripy agent API as a back end.

A [Java Keystore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_KeyStore) is a non-related concept!

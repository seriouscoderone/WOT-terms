# schema-namespace-registry

a centrally managed [schema registry](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/schema-registry.md) where corporations or individuals reserve schemas within a specific [namespace](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/namespace.md) in order to have an interoperable schema that is labeled with a corporation-specific or individual-specific namespace.

[Graphs](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/directed-acyclic-graph.md) in ACDC have decentralised the old-school schema registry, so it's [interoperable](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/interoperability.md) by design.

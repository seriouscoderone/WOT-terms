# code-table-selector

the first character in the text code of [CESR stream](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/composable-event-streaming-representation.md) that determines which [code table](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/code-table.md) to use, either a default code table or a code table selector character when not the default code table. Thus the 1 character text code table must do double duty. It must provide selectors for the different text code tables and also provide type codes for the most popular primitives that have a pad size of 1 that appear is the default code table.

See row 1.

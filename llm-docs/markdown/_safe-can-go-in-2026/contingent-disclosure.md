# contingent-disclosure

Contingent disclosure is a privacy-preserving mechanism where only specific information or attributes are disclosed under defined conditions. It enables the selective sharing of data such that only the required information is revealed to a relying party, without exposing other unrelated or sensitive details. [Chain link confidentiality](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/chain-link-confidentiality.md) is a form of contingent disclosure.

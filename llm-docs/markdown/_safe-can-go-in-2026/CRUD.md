# CRUD

Is acronym for the traditional _client-server_ database update policy is CRUD (**Create, Read, Update, Delete**).

CRUD as opposed to [RUN](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/RUN.md) which is the acronym for the new peer-to-peer end-verifiable monotonic update policy.

We [RUN off the CRUD](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/run-off-the-crud.md), which means that because the source of truth for each data item is a decentralized controller Peer, a given database hosted by any Peer does not create records in the traditional sense of a server creating records for a client.

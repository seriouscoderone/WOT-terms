# most-compact

An [ACDC](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/ACDC.md) that, for a given level of disclosure, is as compact as it can be, which means

-   it has the [SAID](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/SAID.md)s for each section that are not disclosed
-   it has expanded sections that are disclosed

Multiple forms of a single ACDC can be called the "most compact" version, given that each level of [graduated disclosure](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/graduated-disclosure.md) will have a "most compacted" version. If all the blocks are expanded to a most compact version, then it becomes fully expanded. If all the blocks are replaced with SAIDs then it becomes fully compacted.

This form is a part of the graduated disclosure objective.

[Fully (expanded)](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/fully-expanded.md) version of an ACDC
[Fully compact(ed)](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/fully-compact.md) version of an ACDC
